# Alpha-stable Double Autoregressive Models
The R code for the maximum likelihood estimation of alpha-stable Double Autoregressive Models.

# Description
The main code is in the "main.R".  
To run the code, "stable_dalpha.R", "stable_dx.R", "stable_dalpha.R" need to be sourced, and "Ef_bA_estimate.RData" needs to be loaded.  
A toy example is given in the "main.R" for the illustration of the MLE for alpha-stable DAR models.
